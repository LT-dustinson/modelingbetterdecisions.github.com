Name: SATIR Model of change
AKA: J-Curve
Summary: Psychologist Virginia Satir's work with families in the 1950's maps the change process.
When the status quo isn't acceptable, new behaviors are introduced.
Performance is likely to drop during the transition period.  Likewise, anxiety may rise.
After new behaviors take root, their benefits become apparent and the improvements represent the new status quo.

Resistance to change is a basic human response.  It must be acknowledged, respected and nurtured.
